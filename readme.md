# How to do this in my project?
- Just change your store a bit
```
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'remote-redux-devtools';    // Import this

const composeEnhancers = composeWithDevTools({
  realtime: true,
  port: 8000    // Port that your remotedev-server running
});

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  initialState,
  composeEnhancers(    // Use this instead of compose from redux
    applyMiddleware(...middleware),
    // other store enhancers if any
  )
);

```
